This data-set contains comprehensive information on global forest cover, deforestation, and related factors. It includes multiple datas:\n\nforest : Data on net forest conversion and changes in forest cover by country over time.\nforest_area : Information on the change in global forest area as a percent of the global forest area.\nbrazil_loss : Details on the loss of Brazilian forest due to specific causes.\nsoybean_use : Data on soybean production and use by year and country.\nvegetable_oil : Vegetable oil production by crop type and year.\n\n\nForest Data\n\n# Get basic information about the dataset\n1# The properties of the data\nforest |&gt;\n2  diagnose() |&gt;\n3  formattable()\n\n\n1\n\nNot displaying the output since it doesn’t have much significance.\n\n2\n\nThe diagnose() is used for data profiling, data quality assessment, and diagnostics.\n\n3\n\nThe formattable package is used to create formatted tables and data frames for better data visualization. This package is particularly useful for creating visually appealing and informative tables for data analysis and reporting.\n\n\n\n\nThe Forest dataset contains information on the change in forest area every 5 years. With 475 observations, the dataset consists of the 4 variables: entity(country), code, year, and the net forest conversion in hectares. The column code has some missing values around 1% and we won’t be using that column anyway since we have entity column.\n\n\nForest Area Data\n\n# Get basic information about the dataset\n# The properties of the data   \n1forest_area |&gt;\n  diagnose() |&gt;\n  formattable()\n\n\n1\n\nNot displaying the output since it doesn’t have much significance.\n\n\n\n\nThe Forest area dataset looks at the change in global forest area as a percent of global forest area amongst a sample of 7846 observations.

Additionally, the variables consisted of entity, code, year, crop oil and production which contains the production vegetable oil, and oil production in tons.

The dataset includes four variables: entity, country, year, and forest loss. The column code has some missing values around 100% and we won’t be using that column anyway since we have entity column.\n\n\nWhy we chose this data-set?\nThe selection of data-sets for this project is driven by both technical and analytical considerations, particularly related to data visualization. Moreover, deforestation is a serious environmental problem with far-reaching effects. Understanding its trends, drivers, and impacts is critical for informed decision-making and environmental protection. The data-set from Our World in Data provides a reliable data with less junk data and also it contains comprehensive set of variables related to deforestation in this scenario. In the context of data visualization, the technical characteristics of a dataset (cleanliness, structure, consistency) play a key role in creating clear and insightful visualizations.\nThe data-set is well-structured, making them suitable for editing and visualizing data. It contains various tables like forest, brazil_loss, soybean_use, forest_area, vegetable_oil and deforestation_by_source that allows analysis to target specific aspects of deforestation. These dimensions enable multi-layered analysis and visualization, allowing you to investigate different aspects of a problem. Different variables and data dimensions allow you to create diverse visualizations to consider different aspects of deforestation.\nThe richness of the data-set provides many opportunities to create effective data visualizations. From time series graphs to choropleth maps to scatter plots, there are many visualization techniques that can effectively convey complex information. In summary, the selection of this data-set is driven by its technical suitability for analysis and its relevance to the critical issue of deforestation."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\nSo we have come with approaches for both of the questions and are described below.\n\nApproach for question 1\nFor this plot, we wanted to visualize how the global area under forests has changed over the years. We wanted to represent this data in a graphical manner and show how reducing forest cover over the years could be related to other ecological changes taking place. To visualize the TidyTuesday data-set which was sourced from Our World in Data, we are planning to clean it further to only get certain parts that are required using dplyr. Out of the data involved we will be mostly focusing in the forest data which contains our columns of focus which is net_forest_conversion, year and country. From our initial analysis, we would not need to create any new variable using the data-set.\nAnd coming the actual visualization part the comparison of the plot will be done through years 1990-2015 as we have slightly better recorded data for these years and using this we should be able to show an overview of changes in forest cover over the past years using ggplot. We are planning to create a map plot for the data of forest area and for specific years across the world using the rnaturalearth, ggmap, cowplot and plotly packages. The mapping of data from data-set to the map plot can also be done using geocode() function which we will be exploring as well.\n\n\nApproach for question 2\nFor this plot, we want to visualize the trend in the production of soybean over the years in the continent of Africa. To perform this task, we are going to use the TidyTuesday data-set which was sourced from Our World in Data and perform data manipulation to obtain a new column showing the total production of soybean. Out of the data involved we will be mostly focusing in the soyabean_use data and columns present in the table are - human_food ,animal_feed and processed. We will then use ggplot to create a line graph to visualize the rate of change in production. Furthermore, we will compare and correlate the increase or decrease in soybean production with the rates of deforestation and afforestation to determine the general trend in both. This data comparison will be done for the years 1990-2013, as the data-set provides an abundance of useful insights. We also might use other data present in the data-set to get some correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nAnd since these are the approaches we intend to explore and solve the problem statement which we came up with, bits and pieces of the approach might change."
