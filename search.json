Moreover, deforestation is a serious environmental problem with far-reaching effects. Understanding its trends, drivers, and impacts is critical for informed decision-making and environmental protection. The data-set from Our World in Data provides a reliable data with less junk data and also contains comprehensive set of variables related to deforestation in this scenario.\nThe data-set is well-structured, making them suitable for editing and visualizing data. It contains various tables like forest, brazil_loss, soybean_use, forest_area, vegetable_oil and deforestation_by_source that allows analysis to target specific aspects of deforestation. Different variables and data dimensions allow us to create diverse visualizations to consider different aspects of deforestation and investigate them.\nThe richness of the data-set provides many opportunities to create effective data visualizations. From time series graphs to choropleth maps to scatter plots, there are many visualization techniques that can effectively convey complex information. In summary, the selection of this data-set is driven by its technical suitability for analysis and its relevance to the critical issue of deforestation."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nThe following are the approaches we will be using for each question.\n\nApproach for question 1\nWe want to visualize how the global area under forests has changed over the years. To represent the available data best, we will be creating a choropleth map of the world that displays the net forest conversion across the world. The comparison of the plot will be done through 1990-2015 for each decade. We are planning to clean it further to only get certain parts that are required using dplyr. For instance, we will focus on examining forest data to address our first research question by determining which columns are relevant to our analysis, which include net_forest_conversion, year and entity. Additionally, data cleaning and preparation will be performed in order to account for missing data. Since we will be analyzing temporal trends, it will prove vital to filter out missing values for the variable year.\nAnd also the data-set doesn’t contain any geographical information to use them to create a map plot. But it has country information in entity variable, which can be used to get the geographical information. We will be using the maps package as an external data source to get the relevant information using map_data() function and then merge the obtained data with our data using the country variable. This creates new variables latitude and longitudes of the respective countries.\nThen we will us the obtained data-set to plot the map plot using geom_polygon() from ggplot. Also, in the data visualization we will attempt to make the plot interactive using plotly package allowing users to enhance their understanding.\n\n\nApproach for question 2\nWe intend to illustrate the trend in the production of soybean over the years in Brazil in this plot. To calculate the entire production, three different soybean consumption are combined together. To perform this task, we are going to use the TidyTuesday data-set which was sourced from Our World in Data and perform data manipulation to obtain a new column showing the total production of soybean. We will be primarily focusing on the soyabean_use data, which is comprised of the columns (variables) human_food ,animal_feed and processed. Utilizing dplyr, we will filter data in the column entity to exclude data from outside the continent of Brazil as the variable includes various countries and continents. Similar to our approach for Question 1, data cleaning and preparation will be performed in order to account for missing data.\nThe rate of change in production will then be visualized using ggplot’s geom_line() and geom_point() methods to construct a time series plot (line and point graph). To evaluate the overall trend in both, we will also compare and correlate changes in soybean production with rates of deforestation and afforestation. The 1990–2013 period will be used for this data comparison as the data-set provides an abundance of useful insights. We also might use other data present in the data-set to get some correlation. In order to correlate the output of soyabean and forest area, we may also utilize bubble plot to observe how the forest area changed specifically in Brazil.\nVariables of focus for both questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\nSource Data-set\n\n\n\n\nentity\nCountry\nforest, forest_area and soybean\n\n\ncode\nCountry Code\nforest, forest_area and soybean\n\n\nyear\nYear\nforest, forest_area and soybean\n\n\nnet_forest_conversion\nNet forest conversion in hectares\nforest\n\n\nforest_area\nPercent of global forest area\nforest_area\n\n\nhuman_food\nUse for human food (tempeh, tofu, etc)\nsoybean\n\n\nanimal_feed\nUsed for animal food\nsoybean\n\n\nprocessed\nProcessed into vegetable oil, biofuel, processed animal feed\nsoybean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nThese are the planned approaches, and we intend to explore and solve the problem statement which we came up with.

    "text": "Question 1: What does the global forest area look like over past decades, highlighting the trends of forest area conversion?\n\nIntroduction\nIn the face of global climate change, It is important to understand the dynamics of forest cover conversion. The first question delves into the net forest conversion data from 1990 to 2015, examining the changes decade-wise for various countries across the world. Utilizing data from tidytuesday which was sourced from Our World in Data, this study explores the dynamics of forest cover alteration over four decades. By visualizing and analyzing the net forest conversion rates from 1990 to 2015, this study aims to shed light on the evolving state of the world’s forests and highlight countries with notable trends in forest expansion and deforestation.\nFor this visualization we focused on the forest dataset provided by Our World in Data. We utilized the net_forest_converstion variable as it gave us a significant information on how forest conversion has been over the years. In the main plot, our attention was directed towards the specific periods of 1990, 2000 and 2010. However, in the animated compilation, we incorporated visualizations from all decades.\n\n\nApproach\nTo address this question, we implemented a choropleth map visualization highlighting the forest conversion for specific decades and spotlighting few countries with extensive forest conversion. We began to scout the data for getting relevant information and noteworthy details. The whole approach can be categorized into Data Preparation and Pre-processing, Visualizing the data and Animating the plots.\nData Preparation and Pre-processing\nTo generate a map plot we needed geographical information which is not present in the dataset and was achieved by utilizing the maps package in R. From this world data we retrieved all the unique countries for further processing and also filtered out Antarctica from the data.\nA custom function, processForest(), is developed to handle the pre-processing of the forest conversion dataset. This function is used filter countries, ensuring all entities present in the map data are included. It also used to categorize countries based on their net forest conversion rates, grouping them into distinct categories. The processed forest conversion data is split into subsets for each decade (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015). The split() function in R is employed to divide the data based on the year column.\n\n\nGlimpse of processForest Function\n# function to pre process the forest dataset\n# input  : dataset - tibble\n#          unique_countries - tibble\n# output : filtered_data - tibble\n\nprocessForest &lt;- function (dataset, unique_countries) {\n  filtered_data &lt;- dataset |&gt;\n    # filtering only entity, year and net_forest_conversion columns\n    select(entity, year, net_forest_conversion) |&gt;\n    # getting all the countires which are not present in forest dataset for a specific years\n    # bind_rows() is used combine combine rows of two data frames\n    bind_rows(\n      # anti_join() is used to return only the rows from the first dataset that isn't having matching rows in the second dataset based on specified key columns\n      anti_join(unique_countries, dataset, by = c(\"region\" = \"entity\")) |&gt;\n        # adding year and net_forest_conversion for that specific year as NA\n        mutate(year = dataset[1, \"year\"], net_forest_conversion = NA)\n    ) |&gt;\n    # renaming USA and UK so that both these countries are matching in world dataset and forest dataset\n    mutate(\n      entity = case_when(\n        entity == \"United States\" ~ \"USA\",\n        entity == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\",\n        TRUE ~ entity\n      )\n    ) |&gt;\n    # creating a categorical variable forest_converstion to group countries based on their forest conversion\n    mutate(\n      entity = coalesce(entity, region),\n      forest_converstion = case_when(\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; -400000 ~ \"&lt;-400k\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; -200000 ~ \"-400k to -200k\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; -100000 ~ \"-200k to -100k\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; 0 ~ \"-100k to 0\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; 100000 ~ \"0 to 100k\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; 200000 ~ \"100k to 200k\",\n        net_forest_conversion &lt; 400000 ~ \"200k to 400k\",\n        is.na(net_forest_conversion) ~ NA_character_,\n        TRUE ~ \"&gt;400k\"\n      )\n    ) |&gt;\n    # ordering forest_converstion column using factors based on the created categories\n    mutate(\n      forest_converstion = as_factor(forest_converstion) |&gt;\n        fct_relevel(\n          \"&lt;-400k\",\n          \"-400k to -200k\",\n          \"-200k to -100k\",\n          \"-100k to 0\",\n          \"0 to 100k\",\n          \"100k to 200k\",\n          \"200k to 400k\",\n          \"&gt;400k\"\n        )\n    )\n  return(filtered_data)\n}\n\n\nA custom function, filterCountries(), is created to identify and extract specific countries of interest. These countries are singled out due to their significant forest conversion.\nVisualization the data and Animating the plots\nThe ggplot2 package in R is utilized to create detailed visualizations for each decade. For each decade, a map is generated where countries are color-coded according to their forest conversion categories. The geom_map() function is employed to plot the world map, and additional layers are added to highlight the noteworthy countries, ensuring they stand out in the visual representation.We’ve encapsulated the common plotting logic for all decades within a function called generateForestConversionPlot(). This function streamlines the process of generating plots for each specific decade.\nWe also developed a function called generatePlotforAnimation(), designed specifically to adjust text sizes in the original plot to enhance clarity during animation and save the resulting plots. The individual plots for each decade are compiled into an animated GIF using the gganimate package. The resulting GIF provides a dynamic overview of the global forest conversion patterns, emphasizing the transformations occurring over the specified decades.\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe concentrated our visual analysis on the decades of 1990, 2000, 2010. As some countries like USA, Russia and Australia are not having any data to visualize for 2015. It is important to note that the animated plots incorporates data from all decades, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire timeline and the evolving patterns in forest cover across different years.\n\n\nFunction used to generate the plot\n# Function for creating the ggplot map plot\n# Using the filtered_forests$`2000` dataset created earlier as a data source\n# using entity as map_id for first layer\n# using forest_convestion as fill aesthetic and word as map for second layer\n# using highlight_filtered_data$`2000` as another dataset for creating another map layer\n# using entity as map_id,forest_convestion as fill aesthetic and highlight_world as map for third layer\n\n# input  : year - integer\n# output : world_plot - plot object\n\ngenerateForestConversionPlot &lt;- function(year) {\n  world_plot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_forests[[as.character(year)]], aes(map_id = entity)) +\n    geom_map(\n      aes(fill = forest_converstion),\n      map   = world,\n      color = \"#B2BEB5\",\n      linewidth = 0.25,\n      linetype  = \"blank\"\n    ) +\n    geom_map(\n      data = highlight_filtered_data[[as.character(year)]],\n      aes(map_id = entity, fill = forest_converstion),\n      map   = highlight_world,\n      color = \"#71797E\",\n      show.legend = F\n    ) +\n    expand_limits(x = world$long, y = world$lat) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = color_mapping, na.value = \"#F2F3F4\") +\n    coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Net Forest Conversion by Country in\", year),\n      subtitle = \"Net change in forest area measures forest expansion minus deforestation\",\n      caption = \"Data source: Our World in Data\",\n      fill = \"Net Forest Conversion (hectares)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_void() +\n    theme(\n      legend.position = \"bottom\",\n      legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15, color = \"azure4\", hjust = 0.5),\n      plot.caption = element_text(size = 12, color = \"azure4\", hjust = 0.95)\n    ) +\n    guides(\n      fill = guide_legend(\n        nrow = 1,\n        direction = \"horizontal\",\n        title.position = \"top\",\n        title.hjust = 0.5,\n        label.position = \"bottom\",\n        label.hjust = 1,\n        label.vjust = 1,\n        label.theme = element_text(lineheight = 0.25, size = 9),\n        keywidth = 1,\n        keyheight = 0.5\n      )\n    )\n  return(world_plot)\n}\n\n\nChange in forest cover for the decade 1990\nIn the 1990 map, the initial phase of global forest conversion is illustrated.

The animated visualizations highlight the dynamic nature of global forest conversion over the years across different countries.\nThe plot reveals significant changes in forest cover over recent decades, with unexpected rises observed in specific countries. Notable positive shifts occurred in the 2000s and 2010s, particularly in countries like the USA, Russia, Australia, China, and India. These improvements might be attributed to global deforestation awareness campaigns, leading to increased forest coverage in these nations. However, a significant portion of South America and Africa continues to bear the brunt of deforestation, with no signs of slowing down, particularly in countries like Brazil and Tanzania. Economically developed continents seem to prioritize reforestation initiatives, contrasting with less economically advantaged regions where such efforts receive comparatively less focus.\nIn conclusion, this visualization offers a compelling narrative of global environmental change, highlighting both challenges and successes in forest conservation efforts. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers and environmentalists providing actionable insights into regional and global trends. Such visualizations can aid in targeted policy formulation, focusing resources where they are most needed, and fostering international collaborations to combat deforestation."

    "text": "Question 2: How has the consumption of Soybean in Brazil changed over time, and how does it impact the afforestation or deforestation rates?\n\nIntroduction\nThe consumption of soybeans, a versatile and globally significant crop, is intricately linked with land use changes, often impacting regions far beyond agricultural fields. In the second question, we focus on the dynamic story of soybean consumption in Brazil. Our central question revolves around the historical evolution of soybean consumption and its potential implications for afforestation and deforestation rates in this vital agricultural region. This analysis aims to unveil the intricate relationship between soybean consumption and environmental changes in Brazil. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how agricultural practices in this key region influence land use, afforestation, and deforestation. This knowledge is invaluable for making informed decisions regarding sustainable land management and conservation practices in this dynamic agricultural landscape.\nFor this visualization, we used soybean_use data which was sourced from Our World in Data and performed data manipulation to obtain a new column showing the total consumption of soybean. The soyabean_use data, comprises of the columns (variables) human_food ,animal_feed and processed.\n\n\nApproach\nCleaning and processing of the dataset includes the following steps:\nSoybean consumption in Brazil:\n\nCreated a new column for calculating the total soybean consumption. Removing totals of countries whose total consumption is 0 using the subset function.\nFiltering for Brazil under the entity column, and year between 1990 and 2013.\n\nForest coverage in Brazil:\n\nFiltering for year between 1990 and 2013 in the forest_brazil dataset.\nThere is a parameter ‘World’ which shows the overall forest coverage data. Filtering out entity as ‘World’ and year between 1990 and 2013, and grouping by year.\nUsing left_join we merge the two tables based on the year column.\nSince we now have percentage data and total data per year, we can calculate the change in forest coverage for Brazil by doing forest_area.x * forest_area.y.\n\n\n\nPre-processing of soybean and forest data\n#Function to pre-process the

between soybean consumption and environmental changes in Brazil is of paramount importance, given the global significance of soybeans as a versatile crop (Pagano & Miransari). The intricate link between land use changes and soybean consumption highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play. By examining the historical evolution of soybean consumption in Brazil, this study sheds light on the potential implications for afforestation and deforestation rates in this key agricultural region. It becomes evident that this had a notable impact on land use in Brazil.\nThe utilization of time series visualization techniques, including geom_line and geom_point, has allowed for a comprehensive overview of the trends over time. These visualizations provide a clear depiction of the steady increase in soybean consumption in Brazil. The data shows a remarkable increase, from approximately 16.4 million pounds of soybeans in 1990 to a staggering 36.87 million pounds in 2013. This indicates a substantial growth over this period (Pagano & Miransari).\nMoreover, the decrease in forest coverage during this period is stark. The forest coverage in Brazil dropped from 588 million hectares in 1990 to 507 million hectares in 2013, representing a significant loss of 81 million hectares of forest land during this time. This reduction in forest area is indicative of the environmental impact in Brazil (Song et al.).\nThe correlation between rising soybean consumption and decreasing forest coverage in Brazil underscores the need for sustainable agricultural practices and conservation efforts. As the global demand for soybeans continues to grow, this study’s findings, supported by the data, serve as a valuable resource for policymakers and stakeholders in the region (Valdez). It underscores the importance of considering the environmental consequences of agricultural expansion and the need for measures to mitigate deforestation. This research contributes to the broader understanding of the complex interplay between agriculture and environmental changes, making it a pivotal step towards more informed and sustainable land management practices in Brazil."
